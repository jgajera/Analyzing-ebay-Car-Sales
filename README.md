# Analyzing-ebay-Car-Sales

### Introduction
We'll work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.

### Goals
The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings using pandas.
We'll also become more familiar with some of the unique benefits jupyter notebook provides for pandas.

### Given: Data Set
The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database/data), but it was reduced to be 50,000 rows and dirtied up a bit to give me a bigger headache (and more practice!) than usual. :-)
